# Segmentation_medical_images
This repository seeks to compare different deep learning models to perform the segmentation task in [the Data Science Bowl 2018 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data?select=stage1_test.zip) , all models can be executed directly from the [TASK_4.ipynb](https://github.com/PhDSGilber/Segmentation_medical_images/blob/main/TASK_4.ipynb) notebook , remember that when working with this repository you must take into account the routes where it is located in order to import the model modules.

If you have any questions regarding the work, you could contact me at: gacorrales@uao.edu.co
