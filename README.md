# Segmentation_medical_images
This repository seeks to compare different deep learning models to perform the segmentation task in [the Data Science Bowl 2018 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data?select=stage1_test.zip) , all models can be executed directly from the [TASK_4.ipynb](https://github.com/PhDSGilber/Segmentation_medical_images/blob/main/TASK_4.ipynb) notebook , remember that when working with this repository you must take into account the routes where it is located in order to import the model modules.
